# 🐍 100 Days of Code – My Python Journey  

I’m following the **100 Days of Code** challenge, but at **my own pace**.  
Instead of rushing through one project per day, I’m documenting **each coding session** so I can focus on *understanding deeply before moving on*.  

This means some projects will take multiple sessions (and therefore multiple “days” in my log). That’s perfectly fine — the goal is **consistency and growth**, not speed.

## Day 1 – September 30, 2025 (Project 1, Part A)  

**What I Learned**  
- How to use the `print()` function to display text.  
- Newline characters `\n` to split text across lines.  
- String concatenation (using `+` to join words together).  
- First experience with `input()` to collect user input.  
- First exposure to `len()` to measure the length of input text.  

**Code I Wrote**  
```python
# Printing basics
print("Hello world!")

# String concatenation and new lines
print("Hello\nWorld")
print("Hello" + " " + "Angela")

# First try at input and length
print(len(input("What is your name?")))
